Welcome to the Colombo Municipal Council's Garbage Collection Optimization Web Application! We are dedicated to creating a cleaner and healthier environment for the city of Colombo. Our web application serves as a platform to streamline and enhance the process of reporting and collecting garbage, with the ultimate goal of making our city cleaner and more sustainable.

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) is committed to providing efficient and effective waste management services. With the collaboration of enthusiastic volunteers and dedicated staff, we aim to tackle the issue of garbage accumulation and its adverse impacts.</p><p> Our web application brings together the power of technology and community involvement to create a cleaner and greener Colombo.

The Green Task Force (GTF) is an integral part of our initiative. Comprising passionate volunteers, the GTF plays a crucial role in reporting incidents of thrown-away garbage. These dedicated individuals capture images of garbage, describe their impact, and provide the exact location of the incidents. Their contributions are invaluable in helping us identify areas that require immediate attention.We believe that community awareness is crucial in achieving sustainable waste management.


 At Colombo Municipal Council, we are continuously working towards improving our services and fostering a cleaner environment for the citizens of Colombo.</P><p> We appreciate the active participation of the Green Task Force volunteers, the dedication of the Green Captain, and the tireless efforts of our garbage collection staff. Together, we can create a city that is not only beautiful but also sustainable for future generations.

Thank you for joining us on this journey towards a cleaner and greener Colombo!
